# List of things to fix

1. DONE Border radius of the grade button when clicked on is too big
2. Instead of an alert when user clicks on grade button early -  make own alert transition
3. DONE When user gets 1 wrong answer - it should not say "1 Wrong Answers" so when its 1 the s should be removed or text content should say "Wrong Answer".
4. I think shuffle function is not working properly. It shuffles but then it picks the same order? Idk doesnt make sense.
